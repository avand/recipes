# Power Start Granola

Start your day in a powerful way. This combination of super-foods will get your
head in the game no matter which side of the bed you rolled out of.

## Ingredients

* Granola (1/2 cup). I get the cheapest and simplest option from the bulk
  section at Whole Foods. You're going to doctor it up so no need to get fancy.
* Shaved almonds (2 tablespoons)
* Shaved coconut (2 tablespoons)
* Raisens (1 small handful)
* Clover honey (1 tablespoon)
* Flax seeds (1 tablespoon)
* Chia seeds (1 tablespoon)
* Sunflower seeds (1 tablespoon)
* Cinnamon (1 teaspon)
* Almond milk (1/2 cup)

## Steps

1. Combine granola, almonds, coconut, and raisens in a cereal bowl.
2. Drizzle honey over combination.
3. Sprinkle on flax, chia, and sunflower seeds.
4. Sprinkle on cinnamon.
5. Toss bowl contents gently with a spoon. The honey creates nice clusters.
6. Add almond milk.
7. Eat immediately.
