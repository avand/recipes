# The Uncommon Sandwich

It's not often that sardines make their way into a sandwich. This is one of my
all time favorite recipes.

* Lettuce
* Honey mustard
* Siracha
* White onion

1.  Toast two slices of bread.
2.  Open sardines and squeeze half a lemon on top. Remove the seeds. Mash the
    sardines, mixing the lemon juice in.
3.  Spread mustard on piece of toasted bread.
4.  Spread avocado on other piece of bread.
5.  Slice a thin cross section of the onion and place on mustard side of bread.
6.  Empty can of sardines on top of the onions.
7.  Drizzle some Siracha on top of the sardines.
8.  Break off one piece of lettuce into two pieces and place over sardines.
