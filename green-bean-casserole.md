This twist on a classic holiday dish features rich nutty and earthy flavors.
It's almost entirely dairy-free, with the exception of some cheese, which can
be left out.

This dish takes about two hours to make.

## Equipment

* Chanterelle mushrooms (large handful)
* Portobello mushroom (1)
* Vidalia onion (1) or can of french fried onions

## Steps

1.  Wash and clean green beans. Rinse the green beans in cold water. Then chop
    of their heads and tails. Set aside.
2.  Clean and sliver mushrooms.
3.  Peel and slice shallots. Thin rings work best.
4.  Chop onion into rings. If you’re using canned onions, skip this and the
    following step.
5.  Toss onion rings in Tabasco Green Pepper sauce. Separate the sliced onion
    into rings and mix with Tabasco in a large bowl.
6.  Evenly cover onion rings with flour. Set aside.
7.  Blanch green beans. Drop into salted boiling water for a few minutes. Then
    rinse with cold water.
8.  Sautee the mushrooms in butter for about 10 minutes or until they release
    their water.
9.  Whisk about 1/4 cup flour and almond milk. Add flour incrementally, whipping
    frequently, until the milk thickens.
10. Mix green beans into mushrooms. Let flavors combine for a few minutes.
11. Finely chop almonds.
12. Evenly coat casserole dish with the sauté.
13. Evenly pour whisked mixture over the dish.
14. Grate nutmeg over the dish.
15. Shred cheese over the dish.
16. Sprinkle chopped almonds over the dish.
17. Cover dish with aluminum foil.
18. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
19. Deep fry onion rings. Fill a deep skillet or saucepan with about an inch of
    fry oil. Heat the oil. You can flick a few drops of water into the oil to
    see if it’s ready. Carefully, add a few rings at a time and cook until
    golden brown. Remove and dry on paper towel. *Deep frying is dangerous
    business.* Be sure not to overheat the oil or over crowd the skillet.
    Remember that oil and water do not mix! It might be good to know where the
    nearest fire extinguisher resides.
20. Cover casserole with fried onion rings.
21. Serve warm.
